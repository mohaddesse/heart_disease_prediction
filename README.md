## Dataset Problems
> This dataset contains information about contains diagnoses of heart disease patients. Machine learning model is needed in order to determine whether a person has heart disease or not

## This notebook aims to:
- Perform dataset exploration using various types of data visualization.
- Build various ML models that can predict whether patients has heart disease or not.
- Export prediction & best model into text file.
- Perform prediction on new example data given.
